===================================================

In procedure proSiNo:goalRULification, the creation
of new type constraint definitions was not complete.

It was OK in those cases where RUL form was reached,
but it was not OK in other cases, where I had for-
gotten to treat certain term variables. For Example:
"t(g(X,Y,Z))" had been properly transformed into a
clause of the form "t(g(X,Y,Z)):-tx(X),ty(Y),tz(Z)",
but "t(g(X,h(Y),Z))" had been badly transformed into
a clause of the form "t(g(X,U,Z)):-tu(U)", wherein
the calls of the form "tx(X)" and "tz(Z)" had been
forgotten.

This error is now (hopefully) eliminated by changes
in the procedures goalRULification, createCall, and
goalExpansion (all in module proSiNo).

Moreover, nullary constant goals (like p, q, r) are
now allowed as input to procedure goalRULification.

In the supporting module auxil, a small bug has been
fixed in procedure fillUpWithANY which is now also
imported and used by the goalRULification procedure.
