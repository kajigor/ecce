<p>To view the Specialisation Tree you need an <a href="http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/main.html" target="_blank">SVG Viewer</a>.
Green edges labelled with <code>unf(L,N)</code> show the unfolding that has been done; where <code>L</code> is the literal number selected and <code>N</code> is the number of the clause resolved with. 
Blue edges denote the descendency relationship at the global control level. 
Solid rectangles containing an definition with a double equality are global tree nodes for which code has been generated. 
Gray nodes are global tree nodes for which no code was generated, either because the node was abstracted or because it is an instance of another node.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> the tree is displayed before the post-processing is run, which may remove certain nodes, e.g., by determinate post-unfolding. 
Dashed gray edges show instance relationships in the global tree, while dashed red edges show were generalisation occurred.</p>
