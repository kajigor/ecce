This describes the installation procedure for the Ciao Development
Environment, including libraries and manuals, from a _source_
distribution. This applies primarily to Unix-type systems (Linux, Mac
OS X, Solaris, SunOS, etc.). It can also be installed with some
limitations in Windows using the Cygnus Win32 development libraries.

   It is recommended that you read the INSTALLATION file that comes
with each component of CiaoDE. However, in many cases it suffices to
follow this summary:

  1. Uncompress and unpackage (using `gunzip' or `bzip2' and `tar
     -xpf') the distribution. This will put everything in a new
     directory whose name reflects the Ciao version.

  2. Once you have uncompressed the source file in an installation
     directory, run:

          ./configure

     This will generate some configuration files. Note that by
     default the system will be configured to be installed in
     /usr/local, with some resonable installation options, and *for
     all users* (for which you will need to run the installation as
     root). In case you want to change the installation choices
     (there are quite a few options!), install elsewhere, or make a
     personal installation, you can use a menu-driven procedure, as
     will be explained below.

     The configure command accepts several options. If you want to
     see a brief description use the `--help' argument:

          $ ./configure --help


          Configures the Ciao compilation and installation settings

          Usage: configure [options]

          Where 'options' is one or more of the following values:

            --help          Show this help.

            --menu          Configure options via a menu (recommended).

            --prefix=PATH   Specifies the common path of the directories in
                            which  the  system  will  be  installed (e.g.,
                            /usr/local, /home/clip, etc.).

            --instype=TYPE  Specifies  the  type  of  installation.   Valid
                            values are 'ins' (default) and 'src'.

            --sysavail=AVL  Specifies the availability of the system. Valid
                            values are 'all' and 'user'.

            --reset         Erase any previous configuration values.

            --default       Configure using default values.

     The `--menu' option shows a menu with configuration options. You
     must follow the instructions that appear on it. When asked for
     the configuration level, if you are happy with the default
     options, select the first option and no questions will be made.
     If you need a higher level of customization, select the last
     option. Note that for CiaoDE development is recommended to use
     the option `--instype=src' and `--sysavail=user', which prepares
     the CiaoDE to run from the sources directly, and configured in
     the user's home directory.

  3. Once the configuration process has finished, run:

           `gmake all'

     This will build executables and compile libraries.

     Note that `gmake' refers to the GNU implementation of the make
     Un*x command, which is available in many systems (including all
     Linux systems and Mac OS X) simply as `make'. I.e., you can try
     simply typing `make install' if `gmake install' does not work.
     If typing `make' stops right away with error messages it is
     probably an older version and you need to install `gmake'.

  4. If you have obtained the CiaoDE source from the cvs repository,
     you need to generate the documentation. This can be done using:

           `gmake docs'

  5. After the compilation completes successfully, run:

           `gmake install'

     This will install everything in the specified directories.

     If you want to see the other options available at top level
     Makefile, run `gmake help'
