Ciao allows @em{annotating} the program code with
@em{assertions}. Such assertions include @concept{type} and
@concept{instantiation mode} declarations, but also more general
properties as well as comments in the style of the @em{literate
programming}. These assertions document predicates (and modules and
whole applications) and can be used by the Ciao preprocessor/compiler
while debugging and optimizing the program or library, and by the Ciao
documenter to build the program or library reference manual.
