@bf{Ciao} is a @index{public domain}, @em{next generation} programming
environment which supports the development and efficient compilation
of @em{logic programs}, @em{constraint logic programs} (CLP),
@em{functional logic programs}, and @em{object-oriented logic
programs}. @bf{Ciao} includes standard @bf{ISO-Prolog}
as a sublanguage and a program development environment similar to that
of traditional Prolog and CLP implementations. However, @bf{Ciao}
extends the Prolog language and improves on traditional Prolog
programming environments in a number of significant ways:

@begin{itemize} 

@item @bf{Ciao} offers support for @em{programming in the large} with
      a robust module/object system, module-based automatic
      incremental compilation (with no need for makefiles), an
      assertion language for declaring (@em{optional}) program
      properties (including types and modes, but also determinacy,
      non-failure, cost, etc.), automatic static inference and
      static/dynamic checking of such assertions, etc.

@item @bf{Ciao} also offers support for @em{programming in the small}
      producing small executables (including only those builtins used
      by the program) and support for writing scripts in Prolog.

@item The @bf{Ciao} compiler generates several forms of
      architecture-independent and stand-alone executables, which run
      with very competitive speed and efficiency.  Library modules can
      be compiled into compact bytecode or C source files, and linked
      statically, dynamically, or autoloaded.

@item @bf{Ciao} supports concurrency (threads), distributed execution,
      concurrent built-in database, and parallelism.

@item The @bf{Ciao} programming environment includes a classical
      top-level with a rich emacs interface source-level debugger
      and a large number of @em{libraries} providing a wide range of
      additional functionality, including persistence, higher-order,
      functions, objects, sockets, foreign language interfaces (C,
      Java, tcltk, etc.), WWW programming, relational DB interfaces,
      support for several control rules, etc.

@item The @bf{Ciao} language has been designed from the ground up to
      be highly extensible (in a modular way) and to allow modular
      program development, global program analysis, and static
      debugging and optimization via source to source program
      transformation, including automatic parallelization.  

@item The latter tasks are performed by the @bf{Ciao preprocessor}
      (@apl{ciaopp}, distributed separately). The @bf{Ciao} system
      also includes a rich @apl{emacs} interface and a number of
      execution visualization tools.

@item The @bf{Ciao} programming environment also includes @apl{lpdoc},
      an automatic documentation generator for LP/CLP programs.  It
      processes Prolog files adorned with (@bf{Ciao}) assertions and
      machine-readable comments and generates manuals in many formats
      including @tt{postscript}, @tt{pdf}, @tt{texinfo}, @tt{info},
      @tt{HTML}, @tt{man}, etc. , as well as on-line help, ascii
      @tt{README} files, entries for indices of manuals (@tt{info},
      WWW, ...), and maintains WWW distribution sites.
