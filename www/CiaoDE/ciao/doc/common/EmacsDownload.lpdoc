@cindex{downloading emacs}

The emacs editor (in all its versions: Un*x, Windows, etc.) can be
downloaded from, for example, @uref{http://www.emacs.org/}, and also
from the many GNU mirror sites worldwide (See
@uref{http://www.gnu.org/} for a list), in the @tt{gnu/emacs} and
@tt{gnu/windows/emacs} directories.   You can
find answers to frequently asked questions (FAQ) about @apl{emacs} in
general at @uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-faq.text} and
about the Windows version at
@uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs.html} (despite
the @apl{ntemacs} name it runs fine also as is on Win9X and Win2000
machines).
