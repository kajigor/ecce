:- comment(appendix, "Note that @pred{combine_attributes/2} and
@pred{verify_attribute/2} are not called with the attributed variables
involved, but with the corresponding attributes instead.  The reasons
are:

@begin{itemize} 

@item There are simple applications which only refer to the
attributes.

@item If the application wants to refer to the attributed variables
themselves, they can be made part the attribute term.  The
implementation of @pred{freeze/2} utilizes this technique.  Note that
this does not lead to cyclic structures, as the connection between an
attributed variable and its attribute is invisible to the pure parts
of the Prolog implementation. 

@item If attributed variables were passed as arguments, the user
code would have to refer to the attributes through an extra call to
@pred{get_attribute/2}.

@item As the/one attribute is the first argument to each of the two
predicates, indexing applies. Note that attributed variables
themselves look like variables to the indexing mechanism.

@end{itemize}

However, future improvements may change or extend the interface to
attributed variables in order to provide a richer and more expressive
interface.

For customized output of attributed variables, please refer to the
documentation of the predicate @pred{portray_attribute/2}.  ").
